        <h2>Tamirul Millat Kamil Madrasah</h2>
        <p lang="ar" dir="rtl">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
      </div>
      <div id="the-message">
        <p>
          All praise is due to Allah, and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah.
            To proceed—
          The greatest nation is the Muslim Ummah. This nation lost its uniqueness in education, culture, economy, and politics a long time ago. The foundation of faith and morality has shattered. The post-British Indian subcontinent stands as living evidence. Bangladesh, once a nurturing ground for Islam, has fallen into multifaceted crises. Gradually, Islamic values and heritage began to erode. The new generation of the Muslim Ummah came under serious threat.

          It was in the 1960s that a new step was taken to awaken this weakened Ummah and to breathe life into its stagnant body — the foundation of the Tamirul Millat Trust. It embarked on a realistic educational mission, combining Islamic and general education. Continuing this journey, in 1997, Tamirul Millat Kamil Madrasha, Tongi was established.<br />

          Its mission is to produce competent Islamic scholars (Alim-e-Deen) who are timely, skilled, and also patriotic, honest, and capable citizens serving every sector of society. A sprawling green campus was dedicated to this mission. Teaching began from pre-primary up to Kamil (postgraduate) classes. Alongside general and science divisions in Dakhil (secondary) and Alim (higher secondary) levels, the Kamil level also included Tafsir (Quranic exegesis) and Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) departments alongside Hadith studies.

          Tamirul Millat has continued its journey, bearing the marks of success. Gradually, the courtyard of Quranic students expanded. Concerned parents felt the need for Deeni (Islamic) education for girls as well.
          In 2012, in response to growing demand, a girls’ branch was established at Tongi. Gradually, girls were included in the curriculum from kindergarten to Kamil level.

          To improve the academic quality of students, special emphasis was placed on Ilm-e-Qira'at (the science of Quranic recitation) and Arabic language education. Special steps were taken to create scholars (Alim-e-Deen) suited to modern times.
          Regular and frequent classes, monthly and semester examinations, and close supervision through co-curricular activities have been playing an effective role in nurturing the talents and abilities of students.
          
          Recognition as the best educational institution at the national level has honored the madrasha under the Madrasha Education Board.
          All praise is due to Allah!
          From its inception to the present day, Tamirul Millat, Tongi has blossomed into a flourishing tree, laden with thousands of flowers and fruits, spreading its fragrance across the world. Its students, aspiring to be worthy callers to Allah (Da'ee Ilallah), are excelling at renowned universities both nationally and internationally, acquiring higher knowledge of Deen.
          The students of this Deeni center have proven their presence by successfully facing all the challenges of the modern age. Their professional achievements have planted seeds of hope across the nation.

          Throughout this long journey, overcoming countless obstacles, the infinite mercy of our Lord has been our firm reliance. The sincerity of the teachers, the firm determination and hard work of the visionary students, the prayers of the parents, and the love of well-wishers at home and abroad have been our provision for the journey.
          The sincere cooperation of all sectors of the education administration of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, and above all, the mercy of Allah, has made our path smooth and strong.
 
          Compared to our lofty goal, our destination is still far away.
          This changing, progressive journey will be a long one, InshaAllah (if Allah wills).
          We hope that all seekers of truth and beauty will remain with Tamirul Millat as companions in this journey and continue to be kind to us in the coming days as well.
          May Allah enable us to firmly stand upon The Straight Path (Sirat al-Mustaqim) by overcoming all our limitations.
          Ameen!
